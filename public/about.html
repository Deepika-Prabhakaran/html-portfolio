<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>I am Deepika, a third-year computer science engineering student with a deep passion for technology and innovation.
   My journey in the tech world began with mastering the basics of programming, particularly in Java, and has since evolved into working on complex projects that address real-world problems. My projects include developing a telemedicine platform for rural areas and a logistics optimization platform using AI, where I focus on streamlining operations and integrating advanced technologies. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in software development and a keen interest in emerging technologies.
</p>
<p>My active participation in hackathons, including Hackmaggedon 2024, where my team secured a spot in the Top 7, has significantly enhanced my problem-solving and collaborative skills. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think creatively and work efficiently under pressure. In addition to my technical pursuits, I am involved in community services and Women In Tech initiatives, reflecting my commitment to using technology to drive positive social change. As a member of AWS User Group for Women In Tech India, I continuously seek opportunities to grow and contribute to the tech community.
</p>
<p>Beyond academics and projects, I enjoy public speaking, writing quotes, and poetry, which allows me to express my creativity and connect with others on a deeper level. My goal is to build a career that not only leverages my technical skills but also has a meaningful impact on society. As I prepare for future placements and internships, I am focused on expanding my knowledge through certifications, courses, and self-driven projects, ensuring I stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
